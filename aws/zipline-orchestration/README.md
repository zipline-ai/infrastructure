# AWS Zipline Orchestration

Installs the shared `charts/zipline-orchestration` chart on EKS and wires AWS
infrastructure into cloud-neutral chart values.

AWS-specific work stays at this layer:

- IAM role annotations for orchestration and compute service accounts.
- AWS Secrets Manager objects projected through the generic chart
  `secrets` values.
- Optional AWS Secrets Store CSI provider.
- Optional AWS Load Balancer Controller.
- NLB annotations on the shared ingress-nginx controller Services.

Networking intentionally matches Azure at the chart boundary: cloud load
balancers pass traffic to ingress-nginx, and Kubernetes Ingress TLS secrets own
TLS termination. ACM-specific load balancer TLS termination can still be layered
through `extra_values`, but is not the default shared path.
